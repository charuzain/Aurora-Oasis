# Aurora Oasis
 Aurora Oasis is a small, cozy boutique hotel with beautiful wooden cabins. To make managing the hotel easier, this app has been created as a custom solution for the staff. It helps with handling bookings, checking cabin availability, and managing guest check-ins.

This app is designed to make daily hotel operations simple and smooth for the staff. Currently, itâ€™s an internal tool used only within the hotel. However, in the future, it will grow to include a customer-facing website(Using NExtJs) where guests can book their cabins online. The website will connect to the same backend system, making everything work together seamlessly.

4 ways of creating date

1)const now = new Date()
2) parse date from date string
 new Date('string)
 3) parse date = new Date('December 24,2025') // own string , not reliable , use it if string is created by javascript
 Z -> UTC - cordinated universal time ,time without any timezone and daylight saving in Lindon

 Moths in javascript are 0 based
